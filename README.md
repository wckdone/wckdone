I think it is time to fix the sad state of BDSM dating. Most BDSM specific sites are filled with bots/scams/pros and are only after our money. FetLife is a better option but their forum format is not friendly for dating. The other alternatives are vanilla dating apps where kinksters are usually censored, and looked down upon.

Because of that I have decided to create a new dating site specifically for BDSM dating upon the following principles:

1. It is not intended to be “my” site, but “our” site.

1. It should be absolutely and completely free, now and forever.

1. It should make users feel safe and confident that they will not be scammed or exploited.

1. It shouldn’t censor users. If it is legal in the western world then it is allowed.

1. It should be accessible, simple and put users’ privacy above all.

To achieve the principles above the following decisions have been made:

1. Email is not required to use the service.

1. A verified photo however is required to access the service.

1. No ads, no third party cookies, no sharing of data no nothing third party. Funding will be 100% by me and a donations scheme may be considered in the future if the service becomes popular.

1. The service will function 100% correctly with Javascript turned off.

1. It will be based on the now popular swipe right scheme. No unsolicited messages unless both users “liked” each other.

1. Absolutely no “pro”, findom, soliciting, or offering of services of any kind.

Some FAQ:

-  Why is a verified photo required?

It is required in order to make the users feel confident about the other person. Also to filter our bots and scammers.

- Why is there only male/female gender option?

This option doesn’t affect verification. You should choose the option that identifies you the best and provide additional details in your profile description if you feel like.

The choice of having only two genders is made for simplicity.

- Why no “role” option?

Same as above this is done for ease of use. You can specify any details in the description. The addition of “role” option will be reconsidered in the future.

- Where do I set my location?

Your location is guessed by your IP to prevent scams and bots from spoofing they location. I am confident that in most cases the approximation will be good enough. An option to set the location manually will be added to address edge/special cases.

- Your site sucks!

I am sorry you feel that way. I have a full time job and only work on this part time. Please be specific on what annoys you the most and will try to fix it as soon as possible.
